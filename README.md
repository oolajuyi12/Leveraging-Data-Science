# Leveraging Data Science for Predictive Monetary Insights: A Comprehensive Analysis of Risk, Fraud, and Customer Segmentation in the Canadian Banking Sector

Welcome to the repository for the project "Leveraging Data Science for Predictive Monetary Insights." This project showcases how advanced data science techniques can be employed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in financial systems, leveraging predictive algorithms and feature engineering. I leveraged the publicly available Finance Data dataset from Kaggle. Check out the dataset file here: "https://1drv.ms/x/c/33194ddcc6fa718f/EbajjdnY4JVPry_oUjRuV8IBIPLBJ3Z2y0lZ1Ze40m-ETw?e=p1QQ9A

**Project Overview**
Fraud detection is critical for maintaining the integrity of financial systems. This project demonstrates a robust approach to identifying fraudulent activities using machine learning models. By analyzing customer financial behaviors and employing predictive algorithms, this project highlights how organizations can proactively mitigate risks and enhance operational security.

**Key Highlights:**
•	Dataset: Finance Data sourced from [Finance Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitindatta/finance-data?resource=download). 
•	Objective: Detect and prevent fraudulent actions in financial transactions.
•	Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and supervised machine learning.
•	Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains customer financial and behavioral data, which includes the following key features:
•	Demographics: Age, Gender.
•	Investment Preferences: Mutual Funds, Equity Market, Debentures, Fixed Deposits, etc.
•	Behavioral Metrics: Spending patterns, days since last interaction, CLV (Customer Lifetime Value).
•	Outcome Variable: is_fraud (indicating fraudulent activities).

**Approach**
1. Data Preprocessing
•	Handled missing values and normalized numerical features.
•	Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Churn).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Identified trends in customer behaviors and fraudulent activities.
•	Visualized correlations between features and target variables.
3. Feature Engineering
•	Enhanced the dataset with engineered features to improve model performance.
4. Model Development
•	Employed classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees) to predict fraudulent activities.
•	Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
5. Model Evaluation
•	Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
•	Assessed feature importance to understand key drivers of fraud.

**Results**
•	Model Performance: Achieved high accuracy and precision in detecting fraudulent actions.
•	Feature Importance: Key features contributing to fraud detection were identified, helping to focus on high-risk areas.
